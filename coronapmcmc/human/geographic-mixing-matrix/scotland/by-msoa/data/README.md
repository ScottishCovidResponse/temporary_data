# Geographic mixing

A table informing the matrix of contacts between different areas

From census flow data.

Note, this matrix is sparse hence only non-zero elements are given. 

However this data really only provides information about commuting to and from work. If there is anything on movement from a) going shopping b) leisure activities or c) going on holiday that would be useful. Even simple spatial kernels would be good.
